# Alpine_Vegetation_Classification_Landsat_Timeseries
This repository include the Google Earth Engine and R scripts to create decadal Landsat growing season composites and classify alpine vegetation. Scripts were developed for the Kosciuszko alpine area in Australia, and therefore, must be updated with relevant training data, spatial files and bands. Features ingested into Recursive Feature Selection listed in Appendix S2.
